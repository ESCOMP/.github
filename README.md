# Organization wide repository to provide default Code of Conduct and various README documents to all repositories

This stores a few files that will show up by default in all ESCOMP repositories on github.com. Each repository can have a custom version of any of the files here that will override files here. But, if those files are NOT in the repository, when you go to `https://github.com/ESCOMP/<repository>` you'll see the default files from here. They will NOT show up in a local clone of the repository, but only on the web through github.com.
